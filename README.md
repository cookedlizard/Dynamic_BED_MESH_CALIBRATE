# Dynamic BED_MESH_CALIBRATE for RatOS
Klipper mesh on print area only (RatOS adaptation)

## Credit
Complete credit goes to ChipCE (https://gist.github.com/ChipCE/95fdbd3c2f3a064397f9610f915f7d02) for the idea and sample code.\
Idea to make it as repository goes to Turge08 (https://github.com/Turge08).

I only remixed it (well, and slightly modified it. It is mostly syntactic sugar anyway).

## Setup
### 1. Download and install the macro
SSH into the RPi and run the following commands:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/kmarty/Dynamic_BED_MESH_CALIBRATE.git
```
